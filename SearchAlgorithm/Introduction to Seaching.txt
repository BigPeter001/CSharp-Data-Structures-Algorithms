Introduction 

Searching is the process of finding a particular item in a collection of items. 
The item may be a keyword in a file, a record in a database, a node in a 
tree or a value in an array etc. 

Why Searching? 

Imagine you are in a library with millions of books. You want to get a specific 
book with specific title. How will you find it? You will search the book in the 
section of library, which contains the books whose name starts with the 
initial letter of the desired book. Then you continue matching with a whole 
book title until you find your book. (By doing this small heuristic method you 
have reduced the search space by a factor of 26, consider we have an equal 
number of books whose title begin with particular char.) 

Similarly, computer stores lots of information and to retrieve this information 
efficiently, we need very efficient searching algorithms. To make searching 
efficient, we keep the data in some proper order. If you keep the data 
organized in proper order, it is easy to search required value or key. For 
example, keeping the data in sorted order is one of the way to organize 
data. 

Different Searching Algorithms 

• Linear Search – Unsorted Input
• Linear Search – Sorted Input
• Binary Search (Sorted Input)
• String Search: Tries, Suffix Trees, Ternary Search.
• Hashing and Symbol Tables
