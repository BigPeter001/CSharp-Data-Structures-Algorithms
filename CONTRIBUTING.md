# Contributing to DSA Repository

Thank you for considering contributing to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Repository! Your contributions are valuable in helping others learn and improve their understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository's page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TimyVillarmia/CSharp-Data-Structures-Algorithms.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch for your work. Choose a descriptive branch name related to the feature or fix you're working on.

   ```
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Write your code, add new data structures/algorithms, or enhance existing ones. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the established coding conventions.

5. **Test Your Code**: If applicable, test your code to make sure it works as expected.

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message. Please follow the convention: "Add feature/algorithm X" or "Fix issue with Y".

   ```
   git commit -m "Add linked list implementation"
   ```

7. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

   ```
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub, select your branch, and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes.

9. **Code Review**: Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or make necessary changes.

10. **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations, you've successfully contributed!

## Guidelines

- Keep the code and explanations concise and clear for educational purposes.
- Follow the coding style and formatting used in the repository.
- If adding a new data structure or algorithm, include an explanation of its use, time complexity analysis, and example code.
